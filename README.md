# Stacks Smart Contract
The amazing Stacks smart contract built in summer 2021 -3- (Special thanks to Stacks Foundation - Xan and Marvin)

I built a simple NFT Auction Marketplace step by step following Xan and Marvin's courses, and the features of the marketplace are as follows:
- Ability to list SIP009-compliant NFTs for a price in STX.
    - The principal listing the NFT is called the *maker*.
    - Ability for the *maker only* to cancel listings.
    - Other users can fulfil a listing; meaning, they can buy the NFT from the marketplace.

Generally I think it is a great start for smart contract <3
Fantastic experience and thanks to Xan and Marvin.
